**Pulstar's**- Pulsar stars are a very rare type of Neutron star that produce radio emission detectable on
Earth and they are of considerable scientific interest as probes of space-time and states of
matter. Their emission spreads across the sky and produces a detectable pattern of
broadband radio emission. However in practice almost all detections are caused by radio
frequency interference and noise, making legitimate signals hard to find.
The main purpose of this problem is to build a simple classifier in order to predict wether a
detected signal comes from a pulsar star or from other sources such as noises,
interferences, etc. In other words, the goal in this assignment is to work with the data to
build and evaluate prediction models that capture the relationship between the descriptive
features and the target feature "target_class". 

Dataset contains data for classifying a star as a pulsar or not. Features are based on
a number of values extracted from astronomical imaging. 

**Data Analysis and RL Agent** - The objective of this is to use the ensemble learning functionality to identify
the extent to which classification performance can be improved through the combination
of multiple models. Experiments will be run on a dataset extracted from US Census data.
The data contains 14 attributes including age, race, sex, marital status etc, and the goal is
to predict whether the individual earns over $50k per year.

The objective of the second question is to explore the usage of reinforcement learning to
learn strategies for combinatorial tasks. Question solved was:
